In the last session we covered the 'what' and the 'why' of catechesis: this time, we'll get as specific as we can about the 'how'.

## Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy

> *What use is it, my brothers and sisters, if some say they have faith but have done nothing? Can that faith save them? If a brother or sister has nothing to wear and lacks food for the day, and one of you tells them, ‘Go in peace. Be warm and satisfied,’ but does not give them what the body requires, what use is that? And so faith by itself, where there is no action, is dead. Then someone will say, ‘You are a believer and I am a doer.’ Show me your faith from what you do. I too, from what I do, will show you my faith.
> You believe that God is one. Well done! The demons believe that as well, and they shudder. Please understand, empty-headed one, that faith without action is dead. Was our father Abraham not made righteous through what he did when he offered his son Isaac upon the altar? Faith, you see, was working with his actions, and through what he did faith was perfected. Then the Scripture which says, ‘Abraham believed God and it was credited to him as righteousness’ was fulfilled, and he was called the Friend of God. And so you see that a person is made righteous from what is done, and not from faith alone. Likewise, was it not from what she did that the prostitute Rahab was also made righteous when she received the messengers hospitably and sent them off by a different road? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without action is also dead.* (James 2:14-26)

In our information-heavy culture, we often spend a lot of time--- too much time, perhaps--- inside our heads. There's a constant demand on us to have an opinion about nearly everything, and to define ourselves by what we *think* about things. One reason why we don't talk about politics or religion in polite conversation is because they touch the core of who we have defined ourselves to be, the opinions that have become our identity.

This modern attitude was reflected in, and in part caused by, the Protestant Reformation. At the same time that the printing press caused an information revolution across Europe, Christian thinkers following Luther and Calvin came to the novel and extreme conclusion that individuals cannot *do* anything to effect their own salvation. 'He is not righteous who does much, but he who, without work, believes much in Christ.' (1518 Heidelberg Disputation, Thesis 25. <https://ca.thegospelcoalition.org/article/martin-luther-sola-fide/>) As a result of the over-abundance of information and the disregard for actions or 'works', the goals of Western Christianity became restricted to simply having the right opinions about theology. The latin *credo* (I believe) came to mean something quite different than it did before. This is a kind of idolatry of the intellect.

At the opposite extreme is another error called 'pietism', which is perhaps even more common today. This is the attitude that ignores doctrine and dogma (and often morality as well) while keeping the veneer of pious practices such as lighting candles and making the sign of the cross. This approach to the Christian life is equally dead and pointless, and is an idolatry of culture and custom.

Finally, there is a third error which is peculiar to our own time. It is often expressed with the sentiment that 'it doesn't matter what your beliefs are, as long as they are genuine and authentic'. It is true that honesty is the best place to start making spiritual progress. But this attitude confuses the origin with the destination, and is idolatry of emotion or feeling.

What we need to cultivate is right thinking, right feeling, *and* right action: Orthodoxy and Orthopraxy. It is in the process of bringing what we think, say, and do into harmony that we literally become more 'holy'--- that is, more unified and whole, not divided and self-contradictory. The high regard we have for the saints should give us a clue that this is by no means an easy task, nor one that we can accomplish by our own strength.

This harmonization of our beliefs, thoughts, feelings and actions is a work of God's grace in our life. But there are habits and practices that we need to adopt on our side to facilitate this transformation. In the words of St Paul:

> *complete your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who is acting in you both to want and to work for approval.* (Philippians 2:12-13)

This and many other examples should remind us that Orthodox faith is not something that we obtain, but instead a path that we follow, and the goal is not to have the right answers to theological question, but to have Christ himself inside our being (Colossians 1:27)

The lives and teachings of the saints give us specific practices to follow in the Orthodox way. You should use this as a template to adapt to your personal needs and interests following the guidance of a spiritual father and your own conscience.

## Study

While information is not an idol, it is an important and essential tool. We have to make an effort to listen, read, and retain some basic information about our faith. Here is a list of some basic categories of facts, as well as the ways we can learn them:

Types of knowledge:

### History

> *Tradition is the living faith of the dead; traditionalism is the dead faith of the living.* (Jaroslav Pelikan, interview with U.S. News & World Report, July 26, 1989. <https://harpers.org/2008/12/pelikan-on-tradition-and-traditionalism/>)

Like or or not, Christianity is a historical faith. If you don't know the past, neither can you understand the present. That may be a bitter pill for those who dreaded the subject in school, but don't worry too much: it's not the dates and details that matter, but the overall timeline. Our history is a story, and what we need to learn are the characters, setting, and plot.

### Dogma

> *...like a wise master builder I have laid a foundation and another is building upon it. But let each person take heed how he or she builds, for no other foundation can be laid other than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.* (1 Corintians 3:10-11)

There are few words that have taken on as negative a connotation as 'dogma'. It often conjures images of the Roman Magisterium and religious persecution, and is associated with the unforgivable sin of the post-modern world, that of being 'close-minded'. As Orthodox we need to reclaim and redeem both the word and the concept, because wielded correctly, dogma is a tool of freedom, not of oppression.

In simple terms, dogma is the concrete understanding of the Church about a particular subject. Orthodox dogmas weren't imposed by fiat or committee, but arose naturally over time in responses to misunderstandings and heresies, because a wrong understanding about important issues will lead us further away, rather than closer to, God.

Not everything in the Orthodox faith is dogmatised, because truth is ultimately not something that can be codified. There is a remarkable diversity in genuine Orthodox thought over time and culture which is a strength rather than a weakness. But the dogmas that we have about our Theology (such as the doctrine of the Trinity), the person of Jesus Christ (first dogmatised at the council of Nicea), and about our idenitity as human beings made in the image of God, are permanent elements of our faith that will never be revised or changed. Like the foundation of a building that demarcates its perimeter, dogma gives us the freedom to build our own individual faith.

## Prayer

> *Never stop praying.* (1 Thessalonians 5:17)

It's no surprise that prayer is an important part of the Christian life. But if you don't already have an active prayer life, you may be surprised at how difficult it is to get one! When the rest of our day is bombarded by over-stimulation and business, it is hard to set aside time for a practise that is hidden and quiet. In a culture that prioritises efficiency and immediacy, prayer often seems to not be very useful for anything in particular. It's something of a "Catch-22" that the wisdom required to recognise prayer's value can often only be gained through the actual practise of praying. It is therefore a discipline that we have to make a conscious decision to adopt, rather than waiting until we feel inspired to pray. Inspiration is usually the result of prayer, rather than it's cause.

The Church helps us to learn to pray in two specific ways: the first is when we are in a church, and the second is when we are at home (or work, school, etc.)

The physical space of the church building as well as the schedule of services held there are set aside and separated from the rest of time and space in order to give us the shelter we need to learn how to pray. The church is a physical sanctuary, the ark in the midst of the flood. It is true that a Christian should pray everywhere and at all times--- however, one has to start *somewhere*, and this is in many ways the ideal place.

It is also true that many people say that they feel closer to God 'in nature' than in a church, especially if the latter is in the middle of a city, and very well may be crowded inside as well as out. On top of that, we feel that we have to be on our good behaviour, standing still and quiet, while our mind often wanders, and we wonder if perhaps we're just wasting our time?

We should not be tempted to take the easy road: the goal of our journey is not to have a certain spiritual feeling, but real communion with Christ. Most of us would benefit from spending more time in the natural world, since 'The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. ... There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard.' (Psalm 19:1,3) It'- merely a case of having our priorities ordered correctly: 'First set your sights on the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be yours as well.' (Mattew 6:33)

When we are 'in the world' --- that is, outside the church --- we still have help to pray, and this again comes in two forms.

Firstly, the time that we put aside for our daily, personal prayer, ideally in a dedicated prayer corner or other dedicated place, is its own kind of sacred space, with all of the benefits of praying in church, in miniature form. In place of the services there are many and varied prayer books which guide and shape our words and thoughts during that time. Following the book does not guarantee that we are praying well (or even praying at all), but it will guard against many easily-preventable mistakes, reassure us that we're heading in the right direction, and give us the words that we would be unlikely to find on our own. As the Jordanville prayer book says in the preparation for receiving the Eucharist, 'Grant me to say boldly that which I desire, O my Christ. Or rather, teach me what I ought to do and say.' (<https://www.ponomar.net/data/jordanville_prayerbook.pdf>)

Secondly, we can memorise the most important prayers and frequently bring them to mind throughout the day. These prayers are very short, and yet extremely powerful, because they contain much of what we believe in a concentrated form. If we have internalised that faith well, it only takes a short phrase or even a single word to pull the entire weight of Orthodox tradition into the present moment.

The greatest of these short prayers is undoubtedly what is called the 'Jesus prayer':

> *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.*

## Worship

> *But a time is coming, and it is here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father is looking for such as these to worship him. God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and Truth.* (John 4:23-24)

The difference between prayer and worship is that prayer is a personal and individual action, while worship is communal and public. The distinction isn't always very clear, since both prayer and worship are often happening simultaneously. But we can notice, for instance, that in a church service the priest, deacon, or other officiant will often pray, and the congregation will follow the prayer with an affirmation, 'Amen.' That assent is a necessary step in order to join our individual prayers together.

Prayer, then, is the work of individuals which are sometimes brought together in worship, while worship itself is the work of the Church as a single body. Our services (although containing a lot of prayer) are primarily the *worship* of God (both directly and through veneration of the Theotokos and the saints) that Christ said would be part of the new covenant.

There is much more to be understood about worship which is best learned through the Divine Liturgy itself, which we'll come back to during catechesis. The important for right now is that, while being in church might benefit our prayer life, we should never think that the church exists to serve us!

## Good Works

As St James tells us, charity towards others is a large part of the Christian lifestyle. Just as Christ became incarnate in the world, our faith needs to be embodied in practical service and not simply intellectual or sentimental. This charity is expressed by sacrificing our time, energy, and money to efforts that demonstrate God's love in a practical way. When we do this we are allowing ourselves to become instruments of God, and manifesting the Gospel. According to the parable of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25), this is the criterion by which we will be judged.

We should try to avoid, however, the ideologies of social justice and equity which are part of a secular social and political agenda. The reason for this is that these movements have a utopian and macro-focus which often hinders rather than aids the simple love of our neighbors. Our attention must always be to God and then to the practical needs of indiviuals who we have a personal relationship with, rather than an abstract notion of 'humanity'.

## The Orthodox Way

>  *"For this commandment which I command you today is not too mysterious for you, nor is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?' Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?' But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.  
"See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil, in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess."* (Deuteronomy 30:11-16)

Anyone who makes these practices--- studying, praying, worshipping, and doing good works--- will over time begin to look, think, and feel, more like a Christian. What we should be aiming for is not the dramatic and extreme, but the kind of organic progress over time that is simple and downright ordinary. An ounce of consistency is worth a pound of enthusiasm.

Nor should we think that the path of 'ordinary' Christians is different from the lives of the Saints when we read of their miracles and feats of asceticism, because it is only their humility and great love that allowed God to act through them in those ways. 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' (Mattew 5:3)

Nevertheless we should come to the Orthodox way with joy and enthusiasm:

> *Therefore we also, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin which so easily ensnares us, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus, the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.* (Hebrews 12:1-2)

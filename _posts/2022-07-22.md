In this introductory session, we'll talk about the reasons why the catechumenate exists, and what your expectations should be about where we're going and what we'll be doing along the way.

## 'So, you want to be an Orthodox Christian?'

> *'For anyone who is in Christ is a new creation.'* (2 Corinthians 5:17)

All of us come from different backgrounds, and have different interests, attitudes, personalities, and lifestyles. And for each of us, something about Orthodox Christianity has captured our attention and brought us closer. We've read books and articles, come to services, and there is something going on in the Church of Christ that we want for ourselves, even to 'acquire the Holy Spirit' of God (St Seraphim) and to have our names written in the Book of Life (Revelation 3:5). Unfortunately there is no magic wand (or sacrament) which can do that for us automatically! But it is possible, and catechesis exists to help us realise that goal.

Catechesis is your preparation for baptism and/or Chrismation. It will involve some practical work and commitment from you. Just like the nine months you spent getting ready for your physical birth, this time is necessary to ensure your successful life as an Orthodox Christian. It is important to recognise that we live in a world that that is often apathetic or hostile to us, and we have no choice but to engage in spiritual warfare with the enemy of our souls on a daily, if not hourly, basis. 'Everyone who is born of God conquers the world' (1 John 5:4) by putting on the spiritual armour of God (Ephesians 6:10-17) Catechesis is the first layer of spiritual armour that you will keep with you for eternity.

## The Church is for (eternal) lifeâ€¦ not just for Christmas (or Pascha!)

> *'Who among you, wanting to build a tower, would not first sit down and count the cost to see if you have enough to complete it? Otherwise, having laid a foundation and not being able to finish it, everyone looking on will start mocking you, saying, "This person started to build, then could not complete it." Or what king going out to engage another king in battle, would not first sit down and consider whether, with ten thousand, he is able to meet the one who comes against him with twenty thousand? And if not, while the other is still far away he sends emissaries to ask for conditions of peace. In the same way, all those who do not renounce everything they have, cannot be my disciples. Salt is good, but if the salt becomes tasteless with what is it to be seasoned? Being fit neither for the land nor for the manure heap, they will throw it out. Let those who have ears for listening, listen.'* (Luke 14:28-35)

Following Christ is not a hobby, nor is it something that we fit into our spare time. The command 'let them disown themselves and take up their cross and follow me' (Matthew 16:24) applies to every Christian without exception. The choice to become a Christian is often a choice of voluntary suffering, and it is only through this 'narrow gate' (7:13) that we reach the joy of the Resurrection. 'Through the cross has joy come into all the world.' (Liturgy of St John Chrysostom)

Part of the purpose of catechesis is to test our resolve. Just like the period of engagement before a couple is married, it's far better to decide that 'this isn't for me' before the wedding than after. The Gospel makes us realise that we might often have to choose between being comfortable, and being truly happy.

If you choose to be a Christian, there is no aspect of your life, however precious or mundane, which will be 'safe' from God. 'Disowning' is often not about giving up, but giving up control, and this is in fact far more difficult. 'For the Lord your God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.' (Exodus 4:24)

How does this work in practise? You might experience 'divine meddling' in the form of guidance from your priest or spiritual father or mother, from someone else in the church, or from the providential coincidences which you may become more aware of over time. But most commonly and importantly it may happen as you discern the 'still small voice' of the Lord (1 Kings 19:12) in private prayer.

Knowing this, it would be good to ask yourself the following questions:

- Are you ready to 'love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind'? (Matthew 22:37)
- Are there aspects of your life that you would resent giving up control over?
- Do you need to talk to a family member about your commitment to Christ and how it might affect your relationship?
- Is there a particular situation in your life (current job, social circle, living situation, etc) that you already know will need to change in order to live as a faithful Christian?

Of course, all Christians struggle to follow Christ's commands for us, and most of us fail on a pretty regular basis. Continual repentance is perhaps the most difficult discipline of all, and therefore also the one that leads us to the greatest joy.

## Am I already Orthodox?

The answer is no... and yes!

> *'"Truly, truly I tell you, if you do not eat the flesh of the Son of Man and do not drink his blood, you do not have life in you. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood have everlasting life, and I shall raise them up on the last day. For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink. Those who eat my flesh and drink my blood remain in me and I in them."'* (John 6:53-56)

It is important to emphasise that being a Christian is not about how we 'self-identify'. We aren't Orthodox because we come to Liturgy, or make the sign of the cross, nor because we agree with Orthodox teaching. Even less because we listen to Ancient Faith Radio! The only claim that any person can make to be a member of Christ's Church is through the sacraments, and in particular, Baptism and the Eucharist. These aren't legal requirements, but simply the thing itself. Just as a household is one because its people live under the same roof and share meals together, God's household is made up of those who have entered into the Church through Baptism like Noah into the ark (1 Peter 3:20-21) and who have a place at the heavenly Eucharist (Revelation 19:9). All the catechesis in the world is wasted effort if it doesn't bring you finally to the fount and to the chalice.

However, this is not the whole story. As St Cyril of Jerusalem called his own catechumens in the 4th century, you are 'communicants in the mysteries of Christ, as yet indeed by calling only, but ere long by grace'. (Catechetical Lectures, Lecture 1) This is a reminder that 'Those who keep his commandments live in him, and he in them.' (1 John 3:24) You are following the command of Christ by being catechised, and it is in this sense that you are already a 'communicant' in his mysteries.

## This is not Theology 101

> *'Knowledge puffs up while love builds up. Those who seem to know something do not yet know anything as they ought, but those who love God are known by him.'* (1 Corinthians 8:1-3)

> *'A theologian is one who prays, and one who prays is a theologian.'* (Evagrius)

The modern world has attached a lot of importance to knowing *about* things. Often one can be an expert in a subject with very little direct experience. An unfortunate side-effect of the availability of information on the internet is that many of us have an over-inflated sense of our own knowledge when it is not based on experience. And those of us who are less prone to this temptation will often feel a little inferior to those who are 'puffed up' in this way.

In Orthodox Christianity, the only experts we have are those who have persevered over many years in prayer and good works, and who teach by their example. If you want to learn about Orthodoxy, you'll be better of auditing a university course.

## This is survival training

> *'But those who persevere to the end shall be saved.'* (Matthew 24:13)

Catechesis isn't here to satisfy your curiosity or to discuss theology, but to ensure your spiritual survival: quite literally, it's meant to keep you out of hell. Perseverance is the result of sound doctrine and sober practice, so we will focus on those two things.

If your faith is like a rocket, you might think of the fuel as being your own will coupled with the energising force of the Holy Spirit: that's your propulsion. Doctrine, on the other hand, is your direction and navigation. All the good intentions in the world aren't helpful if you're not oriented in the right direction, that is, towards Christ. Both are needed for success.

## Expectations

And now for the practical stuff:

- We'll meet regularly over several months to cover all the necessary topics. You'll want to be able to make the majority of these (either in person of remotely) in order to keep up.
- You'll be expected to be picking up your Bible daily (or as close to that as possible), and to try to keep a daily prayer rule. Both of those together could be as little as 10 minutes of your time if you are busy, but it's essential.
- As a catechumen it's not expected that you'll be at the Liturgy every Sunday (although it's great if you can). But the more time you can spend in church (either here or elsewhere) the better you'll get on, probably.
- You might like to keep some or all of the fasting times in some way. Don't be hard on yourself. But you might want to 'experiment' in this area to know what you're signing up for!
- At the end of the journey, unless there are any pastoral concerns, you'll be invited to be received into the Church, either by Baptism or simply Chrismation. But if you have any remaining concerns or don't feel ready yet for any reason, we'll continue to support you on an individual basis.
- What is shared in group discussion stays in the group. The one exception to this is that I will raise any pastoral concerns to Father Michael in confidence.

**Most importantly: you are expected to love each other in Christ, to respect each other, and to obey our Fathers.** In short, you're expected to act like a Christian.

## The Reality of Experience

In the [last session]({% post_url 2023-10-01-truth-in-the-age-of-information %}), I used a simple thought experiment to suggest that scientific skepticism is not, in fact, the best way to address a simple question such as 'How was your day?'
In reading Fr. Seraphim Rose's excellent 'Orthodox Survival Course' (PDFs are freely available [here](https://saintkosmas.org/orthodox-survival-course)), I came across the section in Lecture 3 entitled 'Copernican Revolution', where I believe he is making a similar point. I've added emphasis at the key point. Here it is:

> The key moment in the rise to power of the scientific faith, the scientific world-view, is the so-called 'Copernican revolution.' ... Copernicus made all kinds of calculations and finally came to the discovery---which was based not on observation; it was based upon mathematical faith---that...the earth goes around the sun together with the planets.

> About this one should say two things: the discovery of this new truth...does not refute the fact that the heavenly bodies do in fact go around the earth because anybody can observe that every day.
**The scientific truth of heliocentricism, that the earth goes around the sun, only explains, on the scientific level, ... the effect we see every day, which is that the sun goes around the earth. In the same way the scientific explanation of greenness, as the joining together of sun, eyes, and a configuration of molecules in a plant, does not change the fact that I see a green forest.
And if I am sound in mind and soul, I delight in it.**
I still see the forest.

>You can explain it on some kind of technical level and maybe even get a deeper understanding of the causes which produce this effect; but the effect is the same. ...And so the Copernican theory does not explain away either the Book of Psalms which talks about 'the sun knoweth his going down' (Ps. 104:19) and does not contradict our daily experience of seeing the sun go around the earth.

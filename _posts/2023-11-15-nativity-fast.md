*'It's the most wonderful time of the year...'*
Christmas seems to bring out the best and the worst of people.
We show our appreciation for other people with Amazon packages purchased on credit, and we make the effort to gather relations together only to be reminded of how dysfunctional those relationships can sometimes be.
And yet the 'spirit of Christmas' is fundamentally Christian, reminding us that Christ makes his appearance in the darkest, coldest part of the year, and journeys with us through the winter and into the new life of Paschal Spring.
That is not to say that the Gospel is a metaphor for the natural year, but rather that the seasons themselves are the metaphor for the work of Christ. (REF Psalm 46?)

Contrary to the culture around us, Christmas is not the biggest holiday (or 'holy-day') of the year. That, of course, is Pascha.
But the Incarnation of Christ is the necessary pre-cursor, taking second place as a 'winter Pascha'[^winter-pascha]
Like Pascha, this great feast is preceded by a lenten fast, though not as long or as strict as Great Lent.
Each of the feasts has its own flavour or note, presenting us with different aspects of the Gospel, like light reflecting from a diamond.
The flavour of the Nativity fast is less about penitence than expectancy, which is why it is known in the West as Advent.
It is meant to open us up to receive what it is that Christmas offers to us, which is Christ himself.

The fast is 40 days long, and so always begins on November 15.
If you are keeping up with the calendar, you will see that with the exception of Wednesdays and Fridays, fish is allowed on most days for the first few weeks, a signal to us that we should not be too strict.
And like the other three fasting seasons, it is punctuated by important feasts: the Entry of the Theotokos into the Temple (21 November) and the feast of Saint Nicholas (6 December).
Nevertheless, we should try our best to fast and pray according to our ability so that Christmas will be a spiritual feast and not merely a sensual one.

The surrounding culture does not do us any favours in this regard.
Judging by actions, anyone would guess that Christmas began sometime in the middle of December, and was well and truly finished by Boxing day!
This unfortunate offset presents us with two opposing dangers.
On the one hand we may lose sight of Advent in the midst of the family get-togethers and work socials, which are most often scheduled during the fast.
On the other hand, we can become puritanically cold-hearted, either refusing to be sociable or else turning up our noses and making others go out of their way to prepare a 'vegan option' for us.
It goes without saying that we should do our best to avoid both of these pitfalls if we can.

What is an Orthodox person to do?
Actually, if these circumstances cause us a little discomfort, that's no bad thing, because it is usually when things are difficult that we learn to pray.
If we have to break the fast for the sake of our relationships with friends and family, we'll have put our priorities in the right order.
And if we are at an event with food, we will be less likely to overeat if we are trying to fast in quantity, if not in quality.
Most importantly, the conflict between the secular celebrations around us and our own spiritual sensitivities may paradoxically cause us to recognise and cultivate the light of Christ as our personal treasure. As St Paul says:

> *We are not proclaiming ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for the sake of Jesus, __because God who has said, 'Out of the darkness light shall shine,' has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the person of Jesus Christ.__ But we have this treasure in clay pots because the supreme power is from God, and not from us.* (2 Corinthians 4:5-7)

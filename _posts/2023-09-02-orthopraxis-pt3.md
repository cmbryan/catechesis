Firstly: Happy New Year (September 1)! If you're wondering whether that's just one more ploy to make the Orthodox seem out of touch with the rest of the world... there's a good reason for it, which we'll get to in the overview of the Church year.

I didn't think this topic was going to be a trilogy, but after 'part 2' I had some good individual discussions on the particulars of what you should be doing while you are a catechumen, and where that might be different from someone who has already been received into the Church.

The following comes with the usual disclaimer that no spiritual practise is 'one size fits all', and guidelines are only that. Experiment, evaluate, and adjust based on your prayer, self-reflection, and guidance from friends, mentors, and spiritual fathers.

So here is a summary of general advice for catechumens:

## Daily prayer

> *If there is no success in prayer, then there will be no success in anything.*[^theophan]

Just do it.

Maybe that seems a little simplistic, but the simple act of doing something every day at a similar time should not be overestimated. Daily rituals&mdash;eating regular meals, going to work, walking the dog&mdash; provide stability and points of reference in an otherwise chaotic world. A habit of prayer works in the same way, but much more powerfully, by grounding our daily existence in the unchanging reality of God.

It may surprise you to learn that the content and duration of your daily prayer is much less important than the regularity. Therefore you should start short and simple, and only increase the time or 'wordiness' after you have kept that rule consistently for a while. 'You have been faithful over a few things; I shall set you over many things.' (Matthew 25:21) Aim to start with 5-10 minutes, once or twice per day.

Just as the repitition of time is important, so also the repetition of words. This is not the repetition of those who 'think that by saying much they will be heard' that Jesus cautioned against (Matthew 6:7), but the recognition that 'your Father knows what you need before you ask him' (v.8), and that our most important concerns are unchanging: our need for grace and mercy, for the strength to love and repent, and for our physical needs.

The most important prayers are short and simple, and you should try to memorise them. Here are a few:

> **To the Holy Spirit**  
> *O heavenly King, the Comforter, the Spirit of Truth,  
> who is everywhere present and fills all things,  
> treasury of blessings and giver of life:  
> Come and abide in us, cleanse us of all impurities,  
> and save our souls, O Good One.*

> **To the Theotokos**  
> *It is truly right to bless you, O Theotokos,  
> ever-blessed and most pure, and the Mother of our God.  
> More honourable than the cherubim,  
> and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim.  
> Without defilement you gave birth to God, the Word:  
> True Theotokos, we magnify you.

> **To God the Father**  
> Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name.  
> Your Kingdom come, Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.  
> Give us this day our daily bread,  
> and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.
> Do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.

> **To the Trinity**  
> Glory to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit. Amen.

> **To Jesus Christ**  
> Lord, Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.

Additionally, there are a number of Orthodox prayer books in print. Most of them have a common core of the same prayers as well as a collection of additional ones that will vary between them. They will all have a daily morning and evening prayer rule, which you should 'cut down' to the size you choose. If you are looking to purchase one, pay attention to the translation (some of them are almost unreadable!), the size, and of course the cost.

Finally, you might come away from Orthodox services believing that the *only* way we pray is with prescribed prayers. **This is not true.** St Theophan also says: 'Don't just read the appointed prayers; speak in your own words and tell Him what is in your heart; ask for help!'[^theophan]

> *...the Spirit also comes to our aid in our weaknesses, for we do not know what to pray for as we should, and so the Spirit intercedes for us with sighs which cannot be put into words. And the one who searches the heart understands the mind of the Spirit...* (Romans 8:26-27)

In your private devotions you should say what is on your mind and heart, or simply use a time of silence when you cannot find the right words. Do not think that your prayer is any better or worse if you have lots to say or little, or whether you are either bored or gushing with emotion. Prayer is action, not feeling.

## Spiritual Reading

A close second to the practise of daily prayer is reading: of the Scriptures in general, the New Testament in particular, and the Gospels in super-particular. Since most of us can't attend church services daily, we won't otherwise hear the lectionary, the sequence of readings that guides us through the Ecclesial year. And even though we can't receive the Eucharist every day, when we read the Gospels we are having a personal encounter with Christ in a similar (albeit lesser) way.

You can find the daily readings here: <https://yorkorthodox.org/wp/saints-readings>

Second to the Scriptures are the many other spiritual writings of Orthodox saints and spiritual fathers and mothers. You may find that you resonate with a particular author and should follow your instincts in this regard with the blessing of your spiritual father, as this can be a great aid to your spiritual growth. But be cautious against elevating one particular voice to the exclusion of the general Orthodox consensus, and you should almost always avoid recent writings, as these haven't had time to be 'vetted' by the Church as a whole.

## Fasting

'Should I fast?' This is probably the single most popular catechumen question! And the answer is a definite maybe.

Being one of the more unusual spiritual practices (at least before veganism and 5:2 dieting were a thing), fasting tends to get a lot of attention. Too much attention, perhaps. The reality is that its importance pales in comparison with the things we spoke about earlier. Nevertheless, all Orthodox Christians are supposed to fast according to their ability and circumstance. So where does that leave the catechumen?

The only way to learn is by doing. How to fast and why to fast are best learned by experience and practise (although most people will tell you that they have spent more time learning how *not* to fast, and why not.) And there's no reason not to start learning right away!

As with prayer, it is best to start with small, consistent changes. If you are following the daily readings you will already notice which days are marked for fasting, and you can begin by being more mindful on those days about what you eat and drink, and why. Are you eating to nourish your body? or to please your senses? or out of compulsion or boredom?

When you are familiar with the habit of awareness, you can then go ahead and subtract something like meat or dairy on a fasting day. Did it provoke a reaction? If so, was it physical, or merely psychological? With several repetitions of this little 'experiment', you will begin to separate the 'daily bread' that your body needs from the passion of indulgence that is harmful to your soul as well as your body.

Whether you find fasting easy or difficult, commit your effort to God in prayer, and don't make a big deal about it. 'Food is for the stomach and the stomach is for food, but God will render both of these obsolete.' (1 Corinthians 6:13)

## Church attendance

One of the commitments you will make when you become an Orthodox Christian is to come to church for the Sunday Liturgy. In that service we pray for 'those who are absent for a reasonable and just cause'&mdash; which doesn't include those who simply made other plans or decided to catch up on sleep. This was taken so seriously in the early centuries of the church that the unexcused absense of three consecutive Sundays could result in being excommunicated![^schaff] Unfortunately, many modern Orthodox have not been taught the importance of coming to church. But that does not excuse us who know better.

That being said, as a catechumen your relationship to the church is slightly different. I'm sure you want to come to services as often as you can, otherwise you wouldn't be here in the first place! However you should not feel under a legalistic obligation.

Each individual comes to the Orthodox Church from a unique trajectory. Some are ready to make the local parish their spiritual home right away, while others may be in the process of 'migrating' from another faith tradition. Still others might need time outside of religious environments to reflect and grow as an individual.

There is no factory assembly line for producing Orthodox Christians. So come to church as often (or not) as you want and are able, and don't compare your own progress to anyone else's.

## Sinful behaviour

There is no time like the present to start routing out any sinful behaviours or practices that you are already aware of in your life. This is not about weaknesses or tendencies, but about specific behavior patterns. For example: 'I like to drink too much' is a weakness; 'I get drunk every Friday after work' is a behaviour pattern.

Don't make the mistake of thinking that patterns will get easier to change over time if you become more 'spiritual'. The truth is often the opposite. Just as prayer is naturally reinforced with practise over time, so is sin. Pray, tell a family member, trusted friend, or spiritual mentor about specific you need to make, and then do it&mdash; the sooner the better (and easier).

## Practising the virtues

> *The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, honesty, goodness, faith, humility and self-control.* (Galatians 5:22-23)

Lastly and more positively, even as a catechumen you should begin looking for every opportunity to practise these 'fruits' or virtues. Again, don't expect these to appear without a little bit of effort on your part, and don't be surprised if you don't notice much change (or any). But look for opportunities to perform a loving action, even if you aren't 'feeling it'. Remind yourself of the reasons you have to be joyful in daily life, and don't hide the truth even if it gets you into trouble. Practise self-control in ways that seem small and inconsequential. And the cumulative effect, with God's help, will benefit you when you come forward for baptism and/or chrismation, attracting His grace and working for your salvation.

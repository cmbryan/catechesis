The lives and teachings of the saints give us some specific practices to follow in the Orthodox way. You should use the following as a template to adapt to your personal needs and interests, following the guidance of a spiritual father and your own conscience.

## Study

While information is not an idol, it is an important and essential tool. We have to make an effort to listen, read, and retain some basic information about our faith. Here is a list of some basic categories of facts, as well as the ways we can learn them:

### History

> *Tradition is the living faith of the dead; traditionalism is the dead faith of the living.* (Jaroslav Pelikan)[^pelikan]

Like or or not, Christianity is a historical faith. If you don't know the past, you simply won't be able to understand what we believe or why we do what we do. That may be a bitter pill for those who dreaded the subject in school, but don't worry too much: it's not the dates and details that matter, but the overall timeline. Our history is a story, and what we need to learn are the characters, setting, and plot.

There are two major categories of history: before the incarnation, and after. The time before Christ is documented in the Old Testament of the Bible, which serves to reveal Christ (John 5:39) and is also revealed by him. (Luke 24:27) The time after Christ centers around the life of the Church from the day of Pentecost to our own time, including the lives of the saints. Being an Orthodox Christian means embracing this Holy Tradition and becoming part of the story ourselves.

### Dogma

> *...like a wise master builder I have laid a foundation and another is building upon it. But let each person take heed how he or she builds, for no other foundation can be laid other than that which has been laid, which is Jesus Christ.* (1 Corintians 3:10-11)

There are few words that have taken on as negative a connotation as 'dogma'. It often conjures images of the Roman Magisterium and religious persecution, and is associated with the unforgivable sin of the post-modern world, which is to be 'close-minded'. As Orthodox we need to reclaim and redeem both the word and the concept, because wielded correctly it is a tool of freedom, not of oppression.

In simple terms, dogma is the concrete understanding of the Church about a particular subject. Orthodox dogmas weren't imposed by fiat or committee, but arose naturally over time in responses to misunderstandings and heresies. It is necessary because a wrong understanding about important issues could divorce us from God rather than bringing us into communion with him.

The opposite of dogma is spiritual delusion, as without any fixed points of bearing, any of us will quickly lose our way. In his novel 'The Great Divorce', C.S. Lewis imagines hell to be a place where we can have anything we wish, but none of it having any actual substance. By embracing correct dogma, we are choosing something more real than any human invention.

Not everything in the Orthodox faith is dogmatised because not everything is critically important, and truth itself is ultimately not something that can be codified. There is a remarkable diversity and even tension in genuine Orthodox thought. This is overall a strength rather than a weakness; and anything which is even remotely 'thorny' need not concern most of us for most of the time. But the dogmas that we have about our Theology (such as the doctrine of the Trinity), the person of Jesus Christ (first dogmatised at the council of Nicea), and about our idenitity as human beings made in the image of God (Christan anthropology), are permanent elements of our faith that will never be revised or changed. In the same way that the foundation of a building permanently demarcates its perimeter, dogma gives us the freedom to build the edifice our own personal faith on a solid, shared foundation of the Apostles.

## Prayer

> *Never stop praying.* (1 Thessalonians 5:17)

It's no surprise that prayer is an important part of the Christian life. But if you don't already have an active prayer life, you may be surprised at how difficult it is to get one! When the rest of our typical day is bombarded by over-stimulation and business, it is hard to set aside time for a spiritual practise that is hidden and quiet. In a culture that prioritises efficiency and immediacy, prayer often seems to not be very useful for anything in particular. It's something of a "Catch-22" that the wisdom required to recognise the value of prayer can often only be gained through the actual practise of praying. It is therefore a discipline that we have to make a conscious decision to adopt, rather than waiting until we feel inspired to pray. Inspiration is usually the result of prayer performed, rather than its cause.

The Church helps us to learn to pray in two specific ways: the first is when we are in church, and the second is when we are at home (or work, school, etc.)

The physical space of the church building as well as the schedule of services held there are set aside and separated from the rest of time and space in order to give us the shelter we need to learn how to pray. The church is a physical sanctuary: the ark in the midst of the flood. It is true that a Christian should pray everywhere and at all times&mdash;however, one has to start *somewhere*, and this is in many ways the ideal place.

It is also true that many people say that they feel closer to God 'in nature' than in a church, especially if the latter is in the middle of a city, and very well may be crowded inside as well as out with people who aren't always our 'type'. On top of that, we feel that we have to be on our good behaviour, standing still and quiet, while our mind often wanders, and we wonder if perhaps we're just wasting our time?

We should not be tempted to take the easy road: the goal of our efforts is not to have a certain spiritual feeling, but to achieve real communion with Christ. Most of us would certainly benefit from spending more time in the natural world, since 'The heavens declare the glory of God; And the firmament shows His handiwork. ... There is no speech nor language Where their voice is not heard.' (Psalm 19:1,3) It's merely a case of having our priorities ordered correctly: 'First set your sights on the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be yours as well.' (Mattew 6:33)

Even when we are 'in the world'&mdash;that is, outside the church&mdash;we still have help to pray, and this again comes in two forms.

Firstly, the time that we put aside for our daily, personal prayer, ideally in a dedicated prayer corner or other dedicated place, is its own kind of sacred space, with all of the benefits of praying in church in miniature form. In place of the services there are many and varied prayer books which guide and shape our words and thoughts as we follow them. Following the book does not guarantee that we are praying well (or even praying at all), but it will guard against many easily-preventable mistakes, reassure us that we're heading in the right direction, and give us the words that we would be unlikely to find on our own. As the Jordanville prayer book says in the preparation for receiving the Eucharist, 'Grant me to say boldly that which I desire, O my Christ. Or rather, teach me what I ought to do and say.' (<https://www.ponomar.net/data/jordanville_prayerbook.pdf>)

Secondly, we can memorise the most important prayers and frequently bring them to mind throughout the day. These prayers are very short and yet extremely powerful, because they contain much of what we believe in a concentrated form. If we have internalised the faith well, it only takes a short phrase or even a single word to pull the entire weight of Orthodox tradition into the present moment.

The greatest of these short prayers is undoubtedly what is called the 'Jesus prayer':

> *Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner.*

## Worship

> *But a time is coming, and it is here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father is looking for such as these to worship him. God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and Truth.* (John 4:23-24)

The difference between prayer and worship is that prayer is a personal and individual action, while worship is communal and public. The distinction isn't always very clear, since both prayer and worship are often happening simultaneously. But we can notice, for instance, that in a church service the priest, deacon, or other officiant will often pray, and the congregation will follow the prayer with an affirmation, 'Amen.' That assent is a necessary step in order to join our individual prayers together.

Prayer, then, is the work of individuals which is often brought together in worship, while worship itself is the work of the Church as a single body. Our services (although containing a lot of prayer) are primarily the *worship* of God (both directly and through veneration of the Theotokos and the saints). This is the worship that Christ said would be part of the new covenant.

There is much more to be understood about worship, which is best learned through the Divine Liturgy itself. The important for right now is that, while being in church might benefit our prayer life, we should never think that the church exists to serve us!

## Good Works

As St James tells us, charity towards others is a large part of the Christian lifestyle. Just as Christ became incarnate in the world, our faith needs to be embodied in practical service and not simply intellectual or sentimental. This charity is expressed by sacrificing our time, energy, and money in ways that demonstrate God's love in a practical way. When we do this we are allowing ourselves to become instruments of God, and manifesting the Gospel. According to the parable of the sheep and the goats (Matthew 25), this is the criterion by which we will be judged!

We should try to avoid, however, the ideologies of social justice and equity which are part of a secular social and political agenda. This is because these movements have a utopian and macro-level focus which often hinders, rather than aids, the simple love of our neighbor. Our attention should always be first towards God and then to the practical needs of the indiviuals we have a personal relationship with, rather than an abstract notion of 'the good of humanity'.

## The Orthodox Way

> *"For this commandment which I command you today is not too mysterious for you, nor is it far off. It is not in heaven, that you should say, 'Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?' Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear it and do it?' But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, that you may do it.  
"See, I have set before you today life and good, death and evil, in that I command you today to love the Lord your God, to walk in His ways, and to keep His commandments, His statutes, and His judgments, that you may live and multiply; and the Lord your God will bless you in the land which you go to possess."* (Deuteronomy 30:11-16)

Anyone who makes these practices&mdash;studying, praying, worshipping, and doing good works&mdash;will over time begin to look, think, and feel more like a Christian. What we should be aiming for is not the dramatic and extreme, but the kind of organic progress that is simple and even slightly boring at times. An ounce of consistency is worth a pound of enthusiasm.

Nor should we think that the path of 'ordinary' Christians is different from the lives of the Saints when we read of their miracles and feats of asceticism. It is only because of their humility, patience and great love that God chose to act through them in those ways. 'Blessed are the poor in spirit, For theirs is the kingdom of heaven.' (Mattew 5:3)

Nevertheless, we should come to the Orthodox way with joy and enthusiasm, for the sake of the goal!

> *Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every burden and the sin which so easily entangles us, and run with endurance the race that is set before us. Let us keep our eyes on Jesus, the initiator and completer of faith, who, setting it against the joy which lay before him, endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.* (Hebrews 12:1-2)

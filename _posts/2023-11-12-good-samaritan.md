Do you want to go to heaven?

In today's Gospel reading, we hear that a lawyer 'tested' Jesus.
Over and over in the Gospels, we see that Jesus allows Himself to be tested by all kinds of people&mdash; not only the Pharisees, but even Thomas, who is invited to probe His wounds in order to show that He is indeed risen from the dead.
And we can be thankful that Christ allows Himself to be tested here, because otherwise we wouldn't have the parable that follows, the parable of the Good Samaritan.
He fulfils the words of the Psalm, 'That You may be justified in Your words, And overcome when You are judged.'
Christ is indeed justified here, and he does indeed overcome.
The lawyer who tests Jesus ends up himself being the one tested, and he leaves with a better understanding of truth.
Hopefully, so do we.

‘Teacher, what have I to do so that I shall inherit everlasting life?’
This is what we might call today a 'loaded question'!
We might be tempted to look down on the lawyer because of his motives&mdash;but on the other hand, how many of us have honestly asked this?
Do we want to learn what it is that _we_ have to do to inherit eternal life?
Or are we content with an earthly inheritance of material things?
Do we want to go to heaven?
'Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness.'

And again like the lawyer, let's not deceive ourselves into thinking that some action is not required on our part in order to inherit God's grace.
The lawyer's question is 'what have I to _do_'?
Let us make that our question, too.
If we want to inherit the life of God, we have to start to act like His children.
So, what does that look like?

It turns out that the lawyer already knows the answer, and it's the right one:
'You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.'
Anyone who does this is a child of God, and will certainly receive the inheritance of eternal life in Him.

St John says this in his first Epistle:
'We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brothers and sisters. Those who do not love the brothers and sisters remain in death.'

Our love for God and for each other is not an emotion, nor is it empty obedience, but something deeper.
It is possible to love God, and yet be angry with him sometimes.
And if you need help knowing how to love someone even when you don't like them very much, just ask my wife, I'm sure she can give you plenty of tips.
But when we're in these situations it's OK, because love is not centred around our emotions but in our will and our freedom to act.
Jesus says about the Samaritan that 'When he saw him, he was moved with compassion'.
Let us also learn to cultivate compassion and to be 'moved' to help one another.

Oftentimes we are less interested in this then on placing limits on our obligations. Our good works can easily become necessary duties rather than the fruit of genuine compassion.
We'll consent to go this far if we have to, but no further.
We want to know when we've done enough to appease God, and after we have fulfilled our obligation, we can safely pass by on the other side of the road.

St Paul picks up this question of obligation in our Epistle reading with the analogy of planting seeds.
How much seed do I need to plant?
The answer is of course, How big a harvest do you want?
There is no obligation in love, only generosity.

The seeds that we have are not our own, but God's grace that has been entrusted to us.
In our generosity they become blessings when we plant them in the lives of the people around us: blessings of our time and attention, our friendship and mentoring, our hospitality, our money, and every simple act of kindness.
And what is the harvest?
Well, it's the eternal life that the lawyer in the Gospel was asking about.
It is a heavenly harvest, because the seed came from God in the first place, not from us.

St Paul quotes Psalm 111 to describe the generous person:
'He has been open-handed; he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains for ever.'

Eternal life.
Heaven is not a reward for those who follow the rules: it's the natural, grace-filled result of generosity and love working themselves out in our life.
The Kingdom of God is within you.

Coming back to the parable, it's interesting how Christ changes the focus from obligation to freedom. The lawyer asks 'who _is_ my neighbour?'
Or in other words, where is the limit of my responsibility?
But after telling the parable, Christ's question in return is different.
He says, 'which of these three, do you think, _became_ a neighbour...?'
According to Jesus, a neighbour is not born, but made by love, and our free will.
Let us be ready to make neighbours of our own and expand the harvest of righteousness.

If all of this still sounds out of reach, remember that our example of being a good neighbour is Christ Himself.
He is the Good Samaritan, who rescues us from the passions that have attacked and wounded us spiritually.
He gives us the healing salve of the Holy Spirit in Baptism and Chrismation, and he carries us to the hospital of the Church so that we can begin the process of healing.
And it is Christ who will return again to square accounts and keep company with us for all eternity.

The extent to which we love is the extent to which we are imitating Him and becoming icons of God.
And let's not forget that this is the definition of the word 'Christian'.
We are becoming who we were made to be.
St Ignatius tells us that 'It is fitting,...not only to be called Christians, but to be so in reality'.

As we enter the season of Advent this week, let us prepare for the coming of Christ in our hearts so that we can begin to love God more fully, and to become a neighbour to the people around us, with the confidence that when we do so we are becoming like Him, and inheritors of God's own, everlasting life.

Amen.


Luke 10:25-37
One of the lawyers stood up, testing Jesus, asking, ‘Teacher, what have I to do so that I shall inherit everlasting life?’ He said to him, ‘What is written in the Law? How do you read it?’ Answering, he said, ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbour as yourself.’ He told him, ‘You have answered correctly. Do this, and you will live.’ But he, wanting to put himself in the right, asked Jesus, ‘And who is my neighbour?’ In reply, Jesus said, ‘A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he was ambushed by robbers. They stripped him, wounded him, and went away leaving him half dead. By coincidence there was priest going down by that road. When he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side. In the same way a Levite also happened upon the place. He came and looked, and passed by on the opposite side. Then a travelling Samaritan came across him. When he saw him, he was moved with compassion. He came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. He lifted him on to his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him. And when he left in the morning he took out two denarii which he gave to the innkeeper, telling him, “Take care of him, and when I return I shall repay you whatever you spend in addition.” Now which of these three, do you think, became a neighbour to the one who was ambushed by robbers?’ He replied, ‘The one who showed mercy to him.’ And Jesus told him, ‘Go and do as he did.’


2 Corinthians 9:6-11
The one who sows meanly will also reap meanly. But the one who sows generous blessings will also reap generous blessings, each as the heart prompts, not grudgingly or under obligation, for God loves a cheerful giver. And God is able to make his grace overflow in you, so that by always having all you need you may overflow with every good deed. As it is written, ‘He has been open-handed; he has given to the poor. His righteousness remains for ever.’ Now may he who provides seed for the sower and bread for food, supply and increase your seed for sowing and multiply the produce of your righteousness, so that you become enriched in every way towards the complete unselfishness that produces within us thanksgiving to God.

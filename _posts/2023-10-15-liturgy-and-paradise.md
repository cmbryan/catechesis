> *[Jesus] said, 'Listen. A sower went out to sow and, as he sowed, some seeds fell by the wayside and the birds came and ate them. Others fell on stony ground where they had little soil. They sprouted immediately because they had no depth of earth, but when the sun came up they were scorched; and since they had no root, they withered. Others fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Others fell into good soil and produced grain: some a hundred times over, and some sixty, and some thirty. Let those who have ears for listening, listen.'* (Matthew 13:3-9)

Last time we saw that the pattern, or icon, of heaven and earth is the key that Scripture gives us to understand both physical and spiritual realities.
This is true both of their distinction and separation as well as their reconciliation and union.
This happens in the material sense through marriage and parenting, and in the spiritual sense through the Word of God taking root in us to bear spiritual fruit.
In this session we will clarify the sense in which heaven is 'higher' and the earth 'lower', and then see how heaven and earth connect in the Divine Liturgy.

## Spiritual Topography

The modern world has a big problem with hierarchy.
Words like 'subordination' and 'subservient' are only used today in negative ways.
Many people think that 'one person, one vote' is the only just form of government, depite the fact that in practise it is often 'two wolves and a lamb voting on what to have for lunch.'[^simkin]
In families, elderly parents are often seen as a burden rather than a source of wisdom or guidance, and our 'prophets' are not elders tempered by experience, but children like Greta Thurnberg.[^prophet]
Even parents increasingly struggle to govern their own children, who are taught in school to actively resist authority in any form.
In adult society we value individualism and skepticism more than tradition and community.
Our ideal is the autonomous person (literally that means 'self-ruled') who frees himself (or herself, or indeed some other non-binary pronoun) from all external constraints.
In the words of a recent advertising slogan, we want 'life without limits', that is, without anything 'above' us to restrict our unlimited free choice.

The toxic effects of this worldview---for ourselves, our societies, and our planet---are becoming increasingly difficult to ignore.
Isolation, depression, and nihilism are the fruit of radical autonomy, and ecological destruction is the result of the consumerism we engage in to try to create an identity for ourselves.
A life without limits, it turns out, also has no centre or direction.
'For those who want to save their life will lose it.' (Matthew 16:25)

As an aside, it is worth emphasising that this is not primarily a question of morality, but of *identity*.
The first of the Ten Commandments is 'I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt ... You shall have no other gods before Me.' (Exodus 20:2-3)
The issue is existential rather than moral: if the Israelites follow other gods, they will simply no longer exist as the chosen people.
Likewise, our existence is rooted in the 'I am' of God's super-existence.
We should not be surprised, then, that the rejection of hierarchy in the modern world is leading to an existential crisis for many people, manifesting as depression, anxiety, fundamentalism, extremism, and a general loss of meaning.
Religion is not a crutch, as some people think, but the ground of being.

## The Mission

> *For this commandment I command you today is not too burdensome for you, nor is it far off. It is not in heaven above, that you should say, 'Who will ascend into heaven for us and bring it to us, that we may hear and do it?' Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, 'Who will go over the sea for us and bring it to us, that we may hear and do it?' But the word is very near you, in your mouth, in your heart, and in your hands, that you may do it.* (Deuteronomy 30:11-14)

As Christians, our primary job is to re-establish a spiritual topography---that is, to become the 'good soil' below which cultivates the Word of God that comes down from above and produces a harvest 'according to its kind and likeness'. (Genesis 1:12)
On a human level we need to learn the humility of submitting to our elders in love and 'lifting' them up in reverence; likewise we need to avoid tyranny towards the younger and weaker, which is life-destroying rather than life-creating.

Thankfully, everything that we do in the Church helps us to do this.
The only thing that is required of us is to leave our radical autonomy and egalitarianism at the door when we come in.
The Church is not a democracy.
The Theotokos is our model, who said in submission 'let it be to me as you have spoken' (Luke 1:38) and so formed the image of God in herself.
This is the pattern that all Christians are to emulate.
In the process we will also be able to say the words of the festal greeting, 'Christ is in our midst!' ('He is, and ever shall be!')

## The Divine Liturgy

> *'But a time is coming, and it is here, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in Spirit and Truth, for the Father is looking for such as these to worship him. God is Spirit and those who worship him must worship in Spirit and Truth.'* (John 4:23-24)

The Divine Liturgy is both the proclamation and the fulfillment of the Gospel.
We are reminded of this with the opening words, 'Blessed is the Kingdom'.
The Kingdom of God is not bound to any one time or place, but it makes use of these elements in symbolic ways.
Nevertheless, like Christ's parables, sometimes we need a little help with the explanation.

Symbolism itself is indicative here: a symbol (or sacrament) is not a metaphor, but an embodiment of a heavenly reality in an earthly form: it is the union of opposites that we have been speaking about.
If we understand these symbols only as an aid to getting to the 'real' meaning, we've missed the point entirely, because it is only in the symbol that the principle becomes reality.
While Christ is talking about the sowing of the seed, the story itself *is* the seed that is being sown by Him.
And it is in this sense that we say that the Liturgy is an icon of the Kingdom, and also the Kingdom itself.
Here are some examples of ways in which it is the restoration of Eden, the hierarchy of paradise.

### Ad orientem

> *In their answers to the queries of the Muslims on the subject, Christian writers never failed to mention that the reason they prayed facing east was due to the fact that the Garden of Eden was planted in the east (Genesis 2:8) and that at the end of time, at the second coming, the Messiah would approach Jerusalem from the east. Consequently, they insisted all Christians face this direction when they pray.*[^griffith]

<p></p>

> *Since, therefore, God is spiritual light, and Christ is called in the Scriptures Sun of Righteousness and Dayspring, the East is the direction that must be assigned to His worship. For everything good must be assigned to Him from Whom every good thing arises. Indeed the divine David also says, Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth: O sing praises unto the Lord: to Him that rideth upon the Heavens of heavens towards the East. Moreover the Scripture also says, And God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there He put the man whom He had formed: and when he had transgressed His command He expelled him and made him to dwell over against the delights of Paradise, which clearly is the West. So, then, we worship God seeking and striving after our old fatherland. ... Moreover Christ, when He hung on the Cross, had His face turned towards the West, and so we worship, striving after Him. And when He was received again into Heaven He was borne towards the East, and thus His apostles worship Him, and thus He will come again ... So, then, in expectation of His coming we worship towards the East.*[^johndamascene]

In our Liturgy, the altar, the clergy, and the people face East in order to worship.
It is important to understand that 'East' is, in this context, synonymous with 'up'.
The sun rises to meet us from the East and we rise to meet it in a powerful, daily image of resurrection.
It is likewise important to remember that we, as individuals coming into the Church, come from the West: that is, we come to the Church as exiles from Eden, from the foreign country with the prodigal son, and as the Israelites returning from Babylon.
This is true in the Baptismal service, where the exorcism and rejection of Satan all happen 'at the back door', so to speak, but also every week when we leave the world to enter the church from the West.

The Liturgy is all about motion, and there is a predominant current of energy that is constantly flowing from the western end of the church, through the nave into the altar, and from the earthly altar ascending to the heavenly prototype.
(There is also an important counter-current, which we'll get to in a minute.)

### Iconostasis, Altar, and Clergy

>*And he gave some to be apostles and others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and others to be shepherds and teachers in order to equip the saints for the work of service, for the building up of the body of Christ until we all arrive at the unity of the faith.* (Ephesians 4:11-13)

One of the criticisms of Orthodoxy is that we seem to have a two-class membership because of our division between clergy and laity.
Of course there is a deeper unity of all Christians as the Body of Christ, and within this unity the division of parts is not only acceptable, but necessary.
But this distinction in particular is so important that it is reinforced in the architecture, vestments, and actions of the Liturgy.
Our clergy serve in the altar, which is divided from the nave by the iconostasis and which is 'higher' in the spiritual topography.
Why is there this division, and why do we not place every indiviual at the same 'level'?
If the clergy remained on the altar and the doors remained shut, this would indeed be wrong.
But as anyone can see, this is not the case.
In all of our services there is a constant coming and going, and who (or what) is entering or exiting the altar is unually the thing that really matters at that moment.
We have already seen that without the division of male and female there would be no children, and without the separation of our brain hemispheres we would not even be able to think.
In the same way, without the separation of the clergy from the laity and the altar from the nave, the Church could not exist.

To this day, even many Orthodox question the taboo against allowing women to enter the altar, with some saying that it is based on mysogynist culture rather than Holy Tradition.
Hopefully even this simple explanation shows that it is rather because the altar _itself_ is by gender masculine, and must be so in order to fulfill its role.
Likewise the congregation is the complementary feminine, in sense of the traditional phrase 'women and children', that is, of mixed gender.
And in the broader context, the Church as one body is 'feminine' in our role as the Bride of Christ, and 'masculine' in our role as a royal priesthood on behalf of the world. (1 Peter 2:5)

There are two particular moments in the Liturgy where we can especially say that the union of the altar and the nave 'make' the Church.
Both go through the middle, or Royal, doors to highlight their importance---the first going in, the second coming out.

### The Great Entrance

>*In the liturgical offertory, the faithful give themselves in sacrifice to God together with Christ. They do so through the Holy Spirit as those who have died and risen with Christ in baptism. In order for the liturgical act of offering to be genuine and true, it must be the living expression of the Church’s constant and total self-offering to God. If each member of the Church is not in perpetual sacrifice with Christ to the Father and is not “bearing his cross” by the power of the Spirit, the offertory entrance of the Divine Liturgy becomes a sterile symbol devoid of reality.*[^hopko-great-entrance]

The Great Entrance is the moment when the offering of bread and the wine is 'revealed' through the North door, processed through the body of the Church with solemn prayers, and then through the Royal Doors onto the altar table.
This is a prophetic statement about the humanity of Christ, who descended from heaven to become one of us, and, as one of us, is able to gather the earth in himself and offer it back to heaven.
We who are in Christ are able to make this offering with Him as His body, and it is in the act of offering that the Church as the "body of Christ" moves from being a theoretical concept to a living reality that we experience, even as simple people in our humble parish.
This transcendence is only made possible because the holy gifts have to cross the border into the altar. It is only that they, and we, can become divine by grace.

### Holy Communion

>*Jesus again called out in a loud voice, and he gave up the spirit. __Then the veil of the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom,__ and the earth quaked, and the rocks split apart. The tombs were opened and the bodies of many holy ones who had fallen asleep were raised. After his resurrection they came out of the tombs, entered the Holy City, and appeared to many.* (Matthew 27:50-53)

This 'veil of the sanctuary' was the Temple equivalent of our iconostasis, that is, the separation of the altar from the congregation.
It, however, did not have a passageway through the middle, until Jesus death and resurrection tore it in half.
We still have this 'tear' today, and that is the Royal Doors.
We should remember this moment of the Gospel every time those doors are thrown open and the Deacon calls out 'With faith and the fear of God, draw near!'
This is the moment of our union, the moment when His life enters our life and _becomes_ our life, when his body and blood are united with ours.
This is the purpose of creation, the image of both Eden in the past and the New Jerusalem in the future, and the mystical revelation of the Church in the present.
It is the axis around which our lives in the world must revolve, if we are to be faithful to Christ.

Holy Communion is a mystery and shouldn't be spoken about too much. For our purposes the important thing is to highlight the union of heaven and earth which is what everything else in our Liturgy and Theology are preparing us to take part in.

## Conclusion: Law and Grace

Finding our place in the Divine Liturgy, and then making everything in our lives one great 'liturgy', is what we mean by receiving 'grace', that is, participating in the life of God (2 Peter 1:4)
This is the meaning behind Christ's prayer before his arrest and trial, 'let your will, not mine, be done.' (Luke 22:42)
Too often, especially as catechumens, we are worried about doing the right things: crossing ourselves from right to left, listening to teachers on the internet, and figuring out whether it's allowed to use vegetable oil on Wednesday.
With humility and a childlike attitude, all these little worries are in fact commendable expressions of love, and no one should discourage them.
But we must be sure not to miss the forest for the trees.
Our life is communion with Christ in the Church and not in following Orthodox customs, even holy ones.

Let us offer our unworthy lives to Christ and with Christ, and in so doing receive Christ who is in himself the union of heaven and earth, being transformed into His likeness and partaking of Divinity through His grace. Amen.

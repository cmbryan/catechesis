## The Infinite Unfolding of Creation

*The past, the present and the future are really one: they are today.*[^stowe]

According to the theory of quantum mechanics, the universe does not either gain or lose information.[^nohiding]
If this is the case, it should not surprise us that the description of the first moment of creation contains keys that can help us understand the meaning of everything that comes after.
What we perceive as time is perhaps only the unfolding of the pattern which existed from the very first moment of existence itself, and is itself the principle by which anything exists at all.
This unfolding, or revelation, of purpose is exactly what the Bible describes, actually.
And the pattern (if that is the best word for it), is a pattern of duality.

In the very first sentence we see not one, but two, pairs, and the relationship between these two creates a third.
First, we see a distinction between God and the creation.
Second, the distinction that we might gloss over if we are reading too quickly, that is, heaven and earth.
It is important that the text does not simply say that God made the universe in the singular, but 'heaven and earth' in the plural.
Finally, the heaven/earth duality is a lower and 'smaller' image of the God/creation duality which emcompasses it.
All three dualities exist at different levels and yet have the same essential dichotomy or pairing, manifested in a fractal way.
And just as in the actual creation, this pattern is revealed to us in the very first moment of the text.

The rest of the story is nothing more than an unfolding of this pattern into the world that we inhabit today: night and day, earth and sea, and so on.
In fact, the further we go into the details, the more dualities we find.
But the big finale, in Chapter 2, is the 'splitting' of Adam to create Eve.
This final act fully reveals the nature of the contrasts that came before, as well as those that would come after.
As St Paul would later write, 'This is a great mystery, but I speak concerning Christ and the church.' (Ephesians 5:32)
We belong to the same pattern as the rest of creation, a pattern that reaches up to God himself.
The image of heaven and earth is embedded into human nature.

## Duality, Ancient and Modern

If this story is really true, using our commonsense definition of truth, it shouldn't surprise us to learn that this basic, gendered duality can be found in diverse cultural expressions across the ancient world.
A familiar and obvious example is the symbol of Yin and Yang, which originated in ancient China, and is still used by practitioners of traditional Chinese medicine to successfully diagnose and treat illness.
In Greek culture, the Caduceus is an image of two intertwined snakes, which represent the peaceful union of opposites in general, and of male and female in particular.[^caduceus]

Nor should it surprise us to see the same duality even in the neurological structure of human and animal brains. Dr Iain McGilchrist has described the unique functions of the left and right hemispheres in ways that parallel the heaven/earth duality in striking ways.

Although we find this pattern of duality described in human cultures across the globe and throughout history, it is in the Bible that we find its full purpose and meaning, which is to show us how to be in right relationship to God, each other, and the rest of the creation.

The beginning of creation, then, is also the beginning of our understanding, and the place where we find the *Logos*, Christ. (John 1)
So much of what the secular world finds arbitrary or strange about the Christian faith is simply the expression of this fundamental principle of duality and relationship.
Out of it arise the basic categories of truth, beauty, and meaning, as well as the capacity to love.
And the goal of the Christian life is to begin to 'live out' these things in practical ways, to embody or bear witness to their reality as more than abstract ideas.
The way this works is by first recognising duality, and then, suprisingly, binding it together in unity.

## *E Pluribus Unum*

As it turns out, duality is not enough, or else the story would be rather short.
There are not two states of matter, but three, and human life is not simply male and female, but the mystery of the two becoming 'one flesh' (Genesis 2:24).
Where there is a duality, a third element is needed to create a bridge between them, one that shares the essential nature of each and binds the two together in harmony: earth and heaven, matter and spirit, male and female, God and humanity.
It is at the boundary, the meeting of ways, where the action of the Biblical story happens.
This action of embracing the other is what we call love.

'God is love, and those who live in love are living in God and God in them' (1 John 4:16) In this passage, the Apostle John makes a startling claim about the very identity of God's being.
He doesn't merely say that God is loving; He is the source of love itself.
The extent to which we understand what it means to love is the same extent that we will be 'in God', and He in us.
Love is the real force behind the principle of duality that we have been exploring.
It is love that binds the two into one, but also that prevents either side from being lost or overpowered in that union.

Love is truly divine, because it originates not in God's relationship to creation, but in the eternal relationship of the Trinity.
This is why we assert the doctrine of the Trinity so emphatically: if the Father was alone before creation, then love would not be is His nature.
As it is, Father, Son, and Spirit have always been in loving relationship, and it is that pre-existing, eternal love that overflows into the created world, bringing it into being and reconciling each part with the whole, and back to God.

## The Crux of the Matter

It is not a coincidence that the cross is made from two lines, nor that the lines are at 90-degree angles, which is to say that they are fully opposite.
They belong to different dimensions: if you were either of these lines, being one-dimensional, the other would simply be invisible to you.
And yet despite their opposition to each other, or rather because of it, they meet in the middle.
The cross is the ultimate image of the union of opposites.

Christ is the Alpha and the Omega (Revelation 1:8), the Son of God and the son of man.
It is because Christ is the *Theanthropos* that he alone stands at the center and is able to gather and hold all things together.
St Paul makes this explicit in the Epistle to the Colossians: '...everything is created through him and for him. He himself is above all, and in him everything is held together. ... For in him the whole Fullness was pleased to dwell,' (the vertical axis), 'and through him to reconcile everything to himself, whether on earth or in the heavens' (the horizontal axis), 'because he has made peace through the blood of his cross.' (Colossians 1:16-20)

The cross is most often seen as God's answer to humanity's sin and rebellion, and that is so.
But reconciliation is not limited to a single 'problem' that God has to fix so that we can get on with other things.
It is rather the necessary counterpart of creation. As soon is something is divided it must be reconciled, held together in loving unity.
Therefore our relationship to the cross is more than a feeling of gratitude for an event that happened in the past.
There never was a time when Christ was not reconciling all things to himself (Colossians 1:20), and there never will be.
The cross, both symbolically and literally, is what that looks like in practise.

## The Ministry of Reconciliation

> *Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here! All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation: that God was reconciling the world to himself in Christ, not counting people's sins against them. And he has committed to us the message of reconciliation.* (2 Corinthians 5:17-19)

> *Then Jesus said to his disciples, 'If there are those who want to come after me, let them disown themselves and take up their cross and follow me.'* (Matthew 16:24)

The cross and the job of reconciliation is not Christ's alone.
Christ's sacrifice does not allow us to avoid our own 'crosses', but to find our own, unique role in the eternal work of reconciliation.
By grace we bear the image of Christ and are being transformed into his likeness, equipping us to be mediators alonside Him and *in* Him, on behalf of the entire world.

Next time, we'll look at how this 'divide-and-reconcile' process appears over and over again in the pattern of our worship and lifestyle.
